 The Displayer class will be used to display out puts to the console that steam from the driver class game. So, any output the user would see
 due to an action caused by interacting with the game class directly, will be displayed from this class. However, this class will not be used
 to display every output to the console, since some outputs will reference information that is local to specific classes.
