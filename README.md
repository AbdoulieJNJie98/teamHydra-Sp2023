   EX: 1~5~12~8~Gigantic Clam ~ The clam has a thick, heavy shell with fluted, or curved edges. The soft tissue, or mantle, inside its shell, displays a pattern and mixture of colors such as yellow, green, iridescent blue, and purple. This large freak of nature is 20 feet wide and sits on the ocean floor, waiting for something to haplessly wander too close to its gaping shell. Due to the issue of mobility, it shouldnâ€™t pose too great a threat to a sub, but discretion is the better part of valor.
