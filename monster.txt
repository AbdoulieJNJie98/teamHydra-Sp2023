1~5~12~8~Gigantic Clam~ The clam has a thick, heavy shell with fluted, or curved edges. The soft tissue, or mantle, inside its shell, displays a pattern and mixture of colors such as yellow, green, iridescent blue, and purple. This large freak of nature is 20 feet wide and sits on the ocean floor, waiting for something to haplessly wander too close to its gaping shell. Due to the issue of mobility, it shouldn’t pose too great a threat to a sub, but discretion is the better part of valor.
2~30~15~5~Enormous Six-Gill Shark~ The bluntnose six gill shark, often simply called the cow shark, is the largest hexanchus shark, growing to 20 ft in length. It is found in tropical and temperate waters worldwide and its diet is widely varied by region. A group of these sharks are bumping into your submarine. How will you handle this?
3~15~12~5~The Dreaded Cookie Cutter Shark~ By far the most dangerous creature in the ocean for your submarine. These 16.5-22 inch critters can inflict actual damage to a submarine. The cookie cutter shark has a long, cylindrical body with a short, blunt snout, large eyes, two tiny spineless dorsal fins, and a large caudal fin. It is dark brown, with light-emitting photophores covering its underside except for a dark "collar" around its throat and gill slits. Make sure they don’t tear through the neoprene boots of your sonar domes or you won’t be able to effectively navigate. Also keep them away from your rubber-sheathed electric cable leading to the sounding probe used to ensure safety when surfacing in shipping zones. Perhaps if you upgraded these systems with fiberglass, you could avoid this nuisance.
4~20~12~7~Macra Terror~ This humongous crab has a rounded body covered with stubby projections and long slim legs. It wields its scissor-like claws with deadly precision. Still, this lumbering giant moves slowly and can be outmaneuvered. This 15-foot-wide crab roams in a consortium, so running into only one is highly unlikely, but ten or more definitely will be present.
5~60~20~15~Narwhal~ This unicorn of the sea is the ocean’s answer to jousting. A medium-sized, toothed whale with a large, spiraled tusk jutting out of its head. This thing might try to pierce the side of your sub, so be careful. This one seems extra aggressive.
6~180~35~20~Colossal Squid~ The colossal squid is a massive squid that lives in the deep-sea surrounding Antarctica, and it is the holder of multiple records. Not only is it the largest invertebrate on Earth, it also has the largest eyes of any animal, larger even than those of the great whales. The beast’s tentacles hold many sharp hooks for capturing prey or defending against their greatest enemy, the sperm whale, who will chow down on some calamari when the mood strikes them. The colossal squid can reach lengths of 39-46 feet and loves to haunt your dreams. It’s trying to get in. What will you do?
